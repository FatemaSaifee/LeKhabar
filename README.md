##  Problem Definition
The following points describe the problems at the client side:
- All application do assist user in providing news but need to be invoked deliberately by user separately
- Most of the applications require their individual process time and response time as they are processed through different servers.
- This also wastage of internet data of the user along with time and memory of device.
- Due to manual system, errors are prone to happen and may hang the mobile device in multiple application run.
- Due to manual system, filteration and scrutiny of presented news feeds need to be done manually, which becomes tedious and complex for the user.

##  Aim
- To design and develop a mobile application that makes the task of news reading and its management more efficient, speedy through effective use of Angular.js and IT project management principles.
- Integration of present multiple platform news-viewing applications into a single window
- An integrated system with zero-breakdowns and failures, and providing effective damage-controlnin case of occurrence of any.
- To increase efficiency and filtration, searching and browsing of news according to genre, news feed provider and category.
- To increase efficiency and space for other applications and reduce complexity
